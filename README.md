# Paddock

## Description

Paddock is an app that combines a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authenticationâ€”-to an intuitive front end. We used the MVC paradigm, created our own server-side API, and used Passport for authentication, and connect to a database.

## User Story

As a Racing Enthusiast, I want to be able to sign up to participate in races with my vehicle, add my vehicles to my garage with their specs, register my vehicles for a race, and see the races that I have signed my cars up for.

As a Track Owner, I want to be able to post track events. Once its posted, I would like to be able to manage my posting by editing and or deleting posted events.


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
WHEN I go to the page but am not authenticated,
THEN I am sent to the login page.
WHEN I log in
THEN I am directed to the homepage where I can view available races and sign my cars up for a race.
WHEN I go to my garage
THEN I can see the cars I have and the races they are signed up for
WHEN I go to my garage
THEN I can add cars to my garage
WHEN I add a car
THEN the car and specs are loaded to the web page
